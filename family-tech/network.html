  <h1>Network-Based Measures</h1>
  <h2>Introduction</h2>
    When it comes to technical solutions, the basic strategy is restricting access to harmful websites.


    Within the scope of technical solutions, this document is going to focus on <em>restricting access to websites</em>.



  <h2>DNS filtering</h2>
  <p>
    When it comes to restricting access DNS is the name of the game.

  <h3>Key Terms</h3>
    The following is a list of key terms in understanding how a home network works.
    Shortened versions of the name are included in parentheses.
    <dl>
        <dt>IP address (IP)</dt>
        <dd>
          Every device which accesses the Internet has an IP address.
        Whenever one device wants to retrieve something from another device (e.g., a computer retrieving a web page from a server), the first needs to specify the IP of the latter.
        An IP address typically looks like a period-separated list of 1-3 digit numbers (e.g., <code>192.168.1.1</code>, <code>12.34.56.78</code>) or less commonly numbers/letters separated by colons (e.g., <code>fd9d:7937:6c16::1</code>).
        </dd>

        <dt>Domain name (domain)</dt>
        <dd>
          The human-readable <q>address</q> for a website, like <code>www.vatican.va</code> or <code>duckduckgo.com</code>.
        </dd>

        <dt>Domain Name Service (DNS)</dt>
        <dd>
          DNS is the process of translating a (typically readable) URL into an IP address.
          For example, DNS translates <code>www.vatican.va</code> into <code>185.152.70.33</code>.
          DNS is always performed by a device accessing a <em>DNS server</em>.
        </dd>

        <dt>DNS Server (DNS)</dt>
        <dd>
          One can think of a DNS server as having a list of domain names and their corresponding IP addresses.
          When a device wants to visit a website, it must contact a DNS to get the domain name translated into an IP.
        </dd>
          
    </dl>

  <h3>Implementing DNS filtering</h3>

  <h3>Whitelisting</h3>


  <h2>Potential problems with DNS filtering</h2>

  <h3>Key Terms</h3>
  <dl>
    <dt>Encryption</dt>
    <dd>
      When a chunk of data is <em>encrypted</em> it is impossible to decipher its contents without the associated key (i.e., password).
      This is generally used to tightly restrict who/what can read a specific piece of data.
