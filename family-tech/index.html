  <h1>Securing Your Home&rsquo;s Information Technology</h1>
  <p>
    A brief guide to configuring your home&rsquo;s technology to better protect your family from harmful content on the web.
  </p>

  <h2>Types of Measures</h2>
  <p>
    There are (at least) three different categories of protective measures that can be taken.
    Each here is given a brief summary along with a link to a page discussing the topic further.
    <dl>
      <dt><a href="devices.html">Devices</a></dt>
      <dd>
        These measures comprise modifying configurations or running software on individual devices (e.g., phones, laptops).
        They give the most powerful
      </dd>

      <dt><a href="network.html">Network</a></dt>
      <dd>
        Those that entail configuring devices in some way or running some sort of software.
      </dd>

      <dt><a href="behavior.html">Behavioral</a></dt>
      <dd>
        Those centering on the <q>human</q> element;
          this can range from where your home computer lives to house rules on technology to philosophical discussion with your family about the role of technology in life.
      </dd>
    </dl>
    Although all three of these work in tandem, <em>behavioral</em> are by far the most important since they train one into virtue rather than just setting up practical barriers.
  </p>

  <h2>Philosophy of This Guide</h2>
  <p>
    This guide is <em>not</em> meant to be the surest fire, least involved way to prevent your children from seeing anything harmful on the web.
    For those purposes, some professionally developed software would be better suited.
  </p>

  <p>
    Instead, the topics of this guide are more geared towards teaching you what is actually going on a technical (and behavioral) level so that you can understand the measures.
    This takes more work, and for that reason may not be for you, but it also comes with an element of ownership (not to mention cost savigns) over the technology in your home.
