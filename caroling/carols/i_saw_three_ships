1. I saw three ships come sailing in,
    On Christmas day, on Christmas day,
I saw three ships come sailing in,
    On Christmas day in the morning.

On Christmas day...
And what was in those ships all three?
On Christmas day...

3. Our Saviour Christ and his lady ...

4. Pray whither sailed those ships all three? ...
Pray whither sailed those ships all three? ...

5. Oh, they sailed into Bethlehem, ...
Oh, they sailed into Bethlehem, ...

6. And all the bells on earth shall ring, ...
And all the bells on earth shall ring, ...

7. And all the Angels in Heaven shall sing, ...
And all the Angels in Heaven shall sing, ...

8. And all the souls on earth shall sing, ...
And all the souls on earth shall sing, ...

9. Then let us all rejoice, amain, ...
Then let us all rejoice, amain, ...
