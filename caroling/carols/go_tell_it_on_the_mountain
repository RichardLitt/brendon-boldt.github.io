(Refrain)
Go, tell it on the mountain
Over the hills and everywhere
Go, tell it on the mountain
That Jesus Christ is born

While shepherds kept their watching
O'er silent flocks by night
Behold throughout the heavens
There shone a holy light
(Refrain)

The shepherds feared and trembled
When lo above the Earth
Rang out the angel's chorus
That hailed our Savior's birth
(Refrain)

Down in a lowly manger
Our humble Christ was born
And God sent us salvation
That blessed Christmas morn

(Refrain)
That Jesus Christ is born
That Jesus Christ is born
