    Caput apri defero
    Reddens laudes Domino

1. The boarâ€™s head in hand bring I,
Bedeck'd with bays and rosemary.
I pray you, my masters, be merry
   Quot estis in convivio

    Caput apri defero
    Reddens laudes Domino

2. The boar's head, as I understand,
Is the rarest dish in all this land,
Which thus bedeck'd with a gay garland
   Let us servire cantico.

    Caput apri defero
    Reddens laudes Domino

3. Our steward hath provided this
In honor of the King of Bliss;
Which, on this day to be served is
   In Reginensi atrio.

    Caput apri defero
    Reddens laudes Domino
