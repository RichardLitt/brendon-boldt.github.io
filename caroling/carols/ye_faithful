1. Oh, come, all ye faithful, triumphantly sing;
Come, see in the manger our Savior and King 
To Bethlehem hasten with joyful accord;
Oh, come, let us adore Him, Christ the Lord! 

2. True Son of the Father, He comes from the skies;
To be born of a virgin He doth not despise.
To Bethlehem hasten with joyful accord;
Oh, come, let us adore Him, Christ the Lord!

3. Hark, hark, to the angels all singing in heaven, 
"To God in the highest all glory be given!"
To Bethlehem hasten with joyful accord;
Oh, come, let us adore Him, Christ the Lord!

4. To Thee, then, O Jesus, this day of Thy birth
Be glory and honor through heaven and earth,
True Godhead Incarnate, Omnipotent Word!
Oh, come, let us adore Him, Christ the Lord!
