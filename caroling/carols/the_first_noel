1. The first Nowel that the Angel did say,
Was to certain poor Shepherds in fields as they lay,
In fields as they lay a-keeping their sheep,
On a cold winter's night that was freezing so deep.

(Chorus)
Nowel, Nowel, Nowel, Nowel,
Born is the King of Israel.

2. They looked up above, to the East where a Star
That beyond them shone out in the Heavens from afar,
And which to the earth did send down a great light,
And so it continued by day and by night.
(Chorus)

3. And then by the light of that bright guiding Star,
There came three Wise Men from a country afar;
To seek for a King, it was their intent,
And to follow the Star wherever it went.
(Chorus)

4. The Star went before them unto the North West,
And seemed o'er the City of Bethlehem to rest,
And there did remain by night and by day,
Right over the place where Jesus Christ lay.
(Chorus)

5. Then entered they all, and those Wise Men three
Most reverently worshiped with low bended knee;
And offered to Christ in His Sacred Presence,
Gifts of Gold, and of Myrrh, and of sweet Frankincense.
(Chorus)

6. And now Christians all, with most gladsome accord,
Sing praises, sing praises to Jesus our Lord,
That made both the Heaven, and the Earth out of nought,
And with His Own Blood our Redemption hath wrought.
(Chorus)
