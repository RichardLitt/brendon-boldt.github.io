1. Oh, praise the blessed Lord of hosts!
Praise the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost!
To all the earth proclaim
The wonders of his fame;
Let all creation,
Ev’ry nation,
Swell the music of his name.

Refrain:
Praise ye the Lord of hosts!
Praise ye the Lord of hosts forevermore!
Let heav’n and earth his matchless name adore.

2. Oh, praise the blessed Lord and King
For gifts which he doth kindly bring!
Oh, let the tidings sound
To all the world around!
Let shouts of glory
Tell the story
Of his saving grace we’ve found.
[Refrain]

3. Oh, praise the blessed Lord for aye,
Thro’ this short life and endless day!
Like mighty thunders’ roll
It sounds from pole to pole.
Let angels singing
Keep it ringing,
He doth sweetly save the soul.
[Refrain]

4. Oh, praise the blessed Lord on high,
Who rules in all the earth and sky!
He reigns upon his throne,
His mighty acts are known.
Let all obey him,
None betray him,
Only such our Lord will own.
[Refrain]
