1. We three kings of Orient are
Bearing gifts, we traverse afar.
Field and fountain, moor and mountain,
Following yonder star.

(Chorus)
O Star of Wonder, Star of Night,
Star with Royal Beauty bright,
Westward leading, Still proceeding,
Guide us to Thy perfect Light.

2. Born a King on Bethlehem plain,
Gold I bring to crown Him again,
    King forever,
    Ceasing never
Over us all to reign.
(Chorus)

3. Frankincense to offer have I;
Incense owns a Deity nigh:
    Prayer and praising
    All men raising,
Worship Him God on high.
(Chorus)

4. Myrrh is mine; it’s bitter perfume;
Breathes a life of gathering gloom: —
    Sorrowing, sighing,
    Bleeding, dying,
Sealed in the stone-cold tomb.
(Chorus)

5. Glorious now behold Him arise,
King and God and sacrifice.
    Heav'n sings
    Halleluia;
Hallelujah the earth replies.
(Chorus)
