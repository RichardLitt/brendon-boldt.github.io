 <br/>The cutest little donkey,
 <br/>You never see him kick.
 <br/>When Santa visits his paisons,
 <br/>With Dominick he'll be.
 <br/>Because the reindeer cannot,

 <br/>They talk Italian to him,
 <br/>And he even understands.
 <br/>
 <br/>Cumpare sing,
 <br/>Cumpare su,
 <br/>And dance 'sta tarantel.
 <br/>When jusamagora comes to town,

God rest you merry, gentlemen,
 <br/>Let nothing you dismay.
 <br/>For Jesus Christ our Savior,
 <br/>Was born on Christmas Day;
 <br/>To save us all from Satan’s power,
 <br/>When we were gone astray.
 <br/>
 <br/>[Chorus]
 <br/>O tidings of comfort and joy,
 <br/>Comfort and joy
 <br/>O tidings of comfort and joy.
 <br/>
 <br/>2. In Bethlehem, in Jury,
 <br/>This blessed Babe was born,
 <br/>And laid within a manger,
 <br/>Upon this blessed morn;
 <br/>The which His mother Mary
 <br/>Did nothing take in scorn.
 <br/>[Chorus]
 <br/>
 <br/>3. From God our heavenly Father,
 <br/>A blessed angel came.
 <br/>And unto certain shepherds,
 <br/>Brought tidings of the same,
 <br/>How that in Bethlehem was born,
 <br/>The Son of God by name:
 <br/>[Chorus]
 <br/>
 <br/>4. Fear not, then said the Angel,
 <br/>Let nothing you affright,
 <br/>This day is born a Savior,
 <br/>Of virtue, power, and might;
 <br/>So frequently to vanquish all,
 <br/>The friends of Satan quite;
 <br/>[Chorus]
 <br/>
 <br/>5. The shepherds at those tidings,
 <br/>Rejoiced much in mind,
 <br/>And left their flocks a feeding,
 <br/>In tempest, storm, and wind,
 <br/>And went to Bethlehem straightway,
 <br/>This blessed babe to find:
 <br/>[Chorus]
 <br/>
 <br/>6. But when to Bethlehem they came,
 <br/>Whereas this infant lay
 <br/>They found him in a manger,
 <br/>Where oxen feed on hay;
 <br/>His mother Mary kneeling,
 <br/>Unto the Lord did pray:
 <br/>[Chorus]
 <br/>
 <br/>7. With sudden joy and gladness
 <br/>The shepherds were beguiled,
 <br/>To see the Babe if Israel,
 <br/>Before His mother mild,
 <br/>O then with joy and cheerfulness
 <br/>Rejoice, each mother's child. 
 <br/>[Chorus]
 <br/>
 <br/>8. Now to the Lord sing praises,
 <br/>All you within this place,
 <br/>And with true love and brotherhood,
 <br/>Each other now embrace;
 <br/>This holy tide of Christmas,
 <br/>Doth bring redeeming grace.
 <br/>[Chorus]
 <br/>
 <br/>9. God bless the ruler of this house,
 <br/>And send him long to reign,
 <br/>And many a merry Christmas
 <br/>May live to see again;
 <br/>Among your friends and kindred
 <br/>That live both far and near. [Alternate Chorus]:
 <br/>
 <br/>        That God send you a happy new year,
 <br/>        Happy new year,
 <br/>        And God send you a happy new year.

 <br/>    On the Feast of Stephen;
 <br/>When the snow lay round about,
 <br/>    Deep, and crisp, and even:
 <br/>Brightly shone the moon that night,
 <br/>    Though the frost was cruel,
 <br/>When a poor man came in sight,
 <br/>    Gath'ring winter fuel.
 <br/>
 <br/>2. "Hither page and stand by me,
 <br/>    If thou know'st it, telling,
 <br/>Yonder peasant, who is he?
 <br/>    Where and what his dwelling?"
 <br/>"Sire, he lives a good league hence.
 <br/>    Underneath the mountain;
 <br/>Right against the forest fence,
 <br/>    By Saint Agnes' fountain."
 <br/>
 <br/>3. "Bring me flesh, and bring me wine,
 <br/>    Bring me pine-logs hither:
 <br/>Thou and I will see him dine,
 <br/>    When we bear them thither."
 <br/>Page and monarch forth they went,
 <br/>    Forth they went together;
 <br/>Through the rude wind's wild lament,
 <br/>    And the bitter weather.
 <br/>
 <br/>4. "Sire, the night is darker now,
 <br/>    And the wind blows stronger;
 <br/>Fails my heart, I know now how,
 <br/>    I can go no longer."
 <br/>"Mark my footsteps, good my page;
 <br/>    Tread thou in them boldly;
 <br/>Thou shalt find the winter's rage
 <br/>    Freeze thy blood less coldly."
 <br/>
 <br/>5. In his master's steps he trod,
 <br/>    Where the snow lay dinted;
 <br/>Heat was in the very sod
 <br/>    Which the Saint had printed.
 <br/>Therefore, Christian men, be sure,
 <br/>    Wealth or rank possessing,
 <br/>Ye who now will bless the poor,
 <br/>    Shall yourselves find blessing.

 <br/>    From heaven’s all-gracious King" –
 <br/>The world in solemn stillness lay

 <br/>Beneath the angel-strain have rolled
 <br/>    Two thousand years of wrong;
 <br/>And man, at war with man, hears not
 <br/>    The love song which they bring; –
 <br/>O hush the noise, ye men of strife,
 <br/>    And hear the angels sing!

 <br/>    Whose forms are bending low,
 <br/>Who toil along the climbing way
 <br/>    With painful steps and slow,
 <br/>Look now! for glad and golden hours
 <br/>    Come swiftly on the wing; –

 <br/>    By prophet bards foretold,
 <br/>When, with the ever circling years
 <br/>    Shall come the age of gold;

 <br/>And the whole world give back the song,

Lo, how a rose e'er blooming,
 <br/>From tender stem hath sprung!
 <br/>From Jesse’s lineage coming, 
 <br/>As men of old have sung. 
 <br/>
 <br/>    It came, a floweret bright, 
 <br/>    Amid the cold of winter
 <br/>    When half spent was the night
 <br/>
 <br/>2. Isaiah 'twas foretold it,
 <br/>The Rose I have in mind
 <br/>With Mary we behold it,
 <br/>The Virgin mother kind
 <br/>
 <br/>    To show God's love aright, 
 <br/>    She bore to us a Savior 
 <br/>    When half spent was the night
 <br/>
 <br/>3. The shepherds heard the story
 <br/>Proclaimed by angels bright,
 <br/>How Christ, the Lord of Glory
 <br/>Was born on earth this night.
 <br/>
 <br/>    To Bethlehem they sped
 <br/>    And in the manger they found him,
 <br/>    As angels heralds said.
 <br/>
 <br/>4. This Flower, whose fragrance tender
 <br/>With sweetness fills the air,
 <br/>Dispels with glorious splendor
 <br/>The darkness everywhere;
 <br/>
 <br/>    True man, yet very God,
 <br/>    From Sin and death he saves us,
 <br/>    And lightens every load.

 <br/>A thrill of hope the weary world rejoices,

 <br/>Here come the wise men from Orient land,
 <br/>The King of Kings lay thus in lowly manger,
 <br/>In all our trials born to be our friend;

 <br/>    The everlasting Light;
 <br/>The hopes and fears of all the years

 <br/>2. O morning stars, together

 <br/>And praises sing to God the King,
 <br/>    And peace to men on earth.
 <br/>For Christ is born of Mary
 <br/>    And gathered all above,
 <br/>While mortals sleep the Angels keep
 <br/>    Their watch of wondering love.
 <br/>
 <br/>3. How silently, how silently,
 <br/>    The wondrous gift is given;
 <br/>So God imparts to human hearts
 <br/>    The blessings of His Heaven.
 <br/>No ear may hear His coming,
 <br/>    But in this world of sin,
 <br/>Where meek souls will receive Him still,
 <br/>    The dear Christ enters in.

 <br/>5. O holy Child of Bethlehem,
 <br/>    Descend to us, we pray!
 <br/>Cast out our sin and enter in,
