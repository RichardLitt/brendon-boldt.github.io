 <br/>Let nothing you dismay.
 <br/>For Jesus Christ our Savior,
 <br/>Was born on Christmas Day;
 <br/>To save us all from Satan’s power,
 <br/>When we were gone astray.
 <br/>
 <br/>(Chorus)
 <br/>O tidings of comfort and joy,
 <br/>Comfort and joy
 <br/>O tidings of comfort and joy.
 <br/>
 <br/>2. In Bethlehem, in Jury,
 <br/>This blessed Babe was born,
 <br/>And laid within a manger,
 <br/>Upon this blessed morn;
 <br/>The which His mother Mary
 <br/>Did nothing take in scorn.
 <br/>(Chorus)
 <br/>
 <br/>3. From God our heavenly Father,
 <br/>A blessed angel came.
 <br/>And unto certain shepherds,
 <br/>Brought tidings of the same,
 <br/>How that in Bethlehem was born,
 <br/>The Son of God by name:
 <br/>(Chorus)
 <br/>
 <br/>4. Fear not, then said the Angel,
 <br/>Let nothing you affright,
 <br/>This day is born a Savior,
 <br/>Of virtue, power, and might;
 <br/>So frequently to vanquish all,
 <br/>The friends of Satan quite;
 <br/>(Chorus)
 <br/>
 <br/>5. The shepherds at those tidings,
 <br/>Rejoiced much in mind,
 <br/>And left their flocks a feeding,
 <br/>In tempest, storm, and wind,
 <br/>And went to Bethlehem straightway,
 <br/>This blessed babe to find:
 <br/>(Chorus)
 <br/>
 <br/>6. But when to Bethlehem they came,
 <br/>Whereas this infant lay
 <br/>They found him in a manger,
 <br/>Where oxen feed on hay;
 <br/>His mother Mary kneeling,
 <br/>Unto the Lord did pray:
 <br/>(Chorus)
 <br/>
 <br/>7. With sudden joy and gladness
 <br/>The shepherds were beguiled,
 <br/>To see the Babe if Israel,
 <br/>Before His mother mild,
 <br/>O then with joy and cheerfulness
 <br/>Rejoice, each mother's child. 
 <br/>(Chorus)
 <br/>
 <br/>8. Now to the Lord sing praises,
 <br/>All you within this place,
 <br/>And with true love and brotherhood,
 <br/>Each other now embrace;
 <br/>This holy tide of Christmas,
 <br/>Doth bring redeeming grace.
 <br/>(Chorus)
 <br/>
 <br/>9. God bless the ruler of this house,
 <br/>And send him long to reign,
 <br/>And many a merry Christmas
 <br/>May live to see again;
 <br/>Among your friends and kindred
 <br/>That live both far and near.
 <br/>(Alternate Chorus):
 <br/>
 <br/>That God send you a happy new year,
 <br/>Happy new year,
 <br/>And God send you a happy new year.

 <br/>    On the Feast of Stephen;
 <br/>When the snow lay round about,
 <br/>    Deep, and crisp, and even:
 <br/>Brightly shone the moon that night,
 <br/>    Though the frost was cruel,
 <br/>When a poor man came in sight,
 <br/>    Gath'ring winter fuel.
 <br/>
 <br/>2. "Hither page and stand by me,
 <br/>    If thou know'st it, telling,
 <br/>Yonder peasant, who is he?
 <br/>    Where and what his dwelling?"
 <br/>"Sire, he lives a good league hence.
 <br/>    Underneath the mountain;
 <br/>Right against the forest fence,
 <br/>    By Saint Agnes' fountain."
 <br/>
 <br/>3. "Bring me flesh, and bring me wine,
 <br/>    Bring me pine-logs hither:
 <br/>Thou and I will see him dine,
 <br/>    When we bear them thither."
 <br/>Page and monarch forth they went,
 <br/>    Forth they went together;
 <br/>Through the rude wind's wild lament,
 <br/>    And the bitter weather.
 <br/>
 <br/>4. "Sire, the night is darker now,
 <br/>    And the wind blows stronger;
 <br/>Fails my heart, I know now how,
 <br/>    I can go no longer."
 <br/>"Mark my footsteps, good my page;
 <br/>    Tread thou in them boldly;
 <br/>Thou shalt find the winter's rage
 <br/>    Freeze thy blood less coldly."
 <br/>
 <br/>5. In his master's steps he trod,
 <br/>    Where the snow lay dinted;
 <br/>Heat was in the very sod
 <br/>    Which the Saint had printed.
 <br/>Therefore, Christian men, be sure,
 <br/>    Wealth or rank possessing,
 <br/>Ye who now will bless the poor,
 <br/>    Shall yourselves find blessing.

 <br/>    From heaven’s all-gracious King" –
 <br/>The world in solemn stillness lay

 <br/>And still their heavenly music floats

 <br/>And ever o'er its Babel-sounds

 <br/>And man, at war with man, hears not
 <br/>    The love song which they bring; –
 <br/>O hush the noise, ye men of strife,

 <br/>3. How silently, how silently
 <br/>The wondrous gift is given!
 <br/>So God imparts to human hearts
 <br/>The blessings of His heav’n.
 <br/>No ear may hear his His coming,
 <br/>But in this world of sin,
 <br/>Where meek souls will receive him still,
 <br/>The dear Christ enters in.
 <br/>
 <br/>4. O holy Child of Bethlehem
 <br/>Descend to us, we pray
 <br/>Cast out our sin and enter in
 <br/>Be born to us today
 <br/>We hear the Christmas angels
 <br/>The great glad tidings tell
 <br/>O come to us, abide with us
 <br/>Our Lord Emmanuel

 <br/>Let us servire cantico.

 <br/>Was to certain poor Shepherds in fields as they lay,
 <br/>In fields as they lay a-keeping their sheep,
 <br/>On a cold winter's night that was freezing so deep.
 <br/>
 <br/>(Chorus)
 <br/>Nowel, Nowel, Nowel, Nowel,
 <br/>Born is the King of Israel.
 <br/>
 <br/>2. They looked up above, to the East where a Star
 <br/>That beyond them shone out in the Heavens from afar,
 <br/>And which to the earth did send down a great light,
 <br/>And so it continued by day and by night.
 <br/>(Chorus)
 <br/>
 <br/>3. And then by the light of that bright guiding Star,
 <br/>There came three Wise Men from a country afar;
 <br/>To seek for a King, it was their intent,
 <br/>And to follow the Star wherever it went.
 <br/>(Chorus)
 <br/>
 <br/>4. The Star went before them unto the North West,
 <br/>And seemed o'er the City of Bethlehem to rest,
 <br/>And there did remain by night and by day,
 <br/>Right over the place where Jesus Christ lay.
 <br/>(Chorus)
 <br/>
 <br/>5. Then entered they all, and those Wise Men three
 <br/>Most reverently worshiped with low bended knee;
 <br/>And offered to Christ in His Sacred Presence,
 <br/>Gifts of Gold, and of Myrrh, and of sweet Frankincense.
 <br/>(Chorus)
 <br/>
 <br/>6. And now Christians all, with most gladsome accord,
 <br/>Sing praises, sing praises to Jesus our Lord,
 <br/>That made both the Heaven, and the Earth out of nought,
 <br/>And with His Own Blood our Redemption hath wrought.

 <br/>Star with Royal Beauty bright,
 <br/>Westward leading, Still proceeding,
 <br/>Guide us to Thy perfect Light.
 <br/>
 <br/>2. Born a King on Bethlehem plain,
 <br/>Gold I bring to crown Him again,
 <br/>    King forever,
 <br/>    Ceasing never
 <br/>Over us all to reign.
 <br/>(Chorus)
 <br/>
 <br/>3. Frankincense to offer have I;
 <br/>Incense owns a Deity nigh:
 <br/>    Prayer and praising
 <br/>    All men raising,
 <br/>Worship Him God on high.
 <br/>(Chorus)
 <br/>
 <br/>4. Myrrh is mine; it’s bitter perfume;
 <br/>Breathes a life of gathering gloom: —
 <br/>    Sorrowing, sighing,
 <br/>    Bleeding, dying,
 <br/>Sealed in the stone-cold tomb.
 <br/>(Chorus)
 <br/>
 <br/>5. Glorious now behold Him arise,
 <br/>King and God and sacrifice.
 <br/>    Heav'n sings
 <br/>    Halleluia;
 <br/>Hallelujah the earth replies.
