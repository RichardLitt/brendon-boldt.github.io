        <h1>Brendon Boldt</h1>

        <p>
        I am a Master of Language Technology student at Carnegie Mellon
        University's Language Technology Institute working with David Mortensen.
        My primary interest is artificial emergent languages from the
        perspectives of machine learning, natural language processing,
        information, linguistics, and philosophy.  Phrased as a series of
        questions,
        <ul>
          <li>What kind of language can machine learning-equipped agents invent in order to cooperate on a task?</li>
          <li>What attributes in the environment correspond to attributes in the emergent language?</li>
          <li>Instead of starting with a fully-formed language and building up an agent's proficiency in it,
            can we build up the agent's proficiency as the language is developed from scratch?</li>
          <li>What even is an interesting question in emergent language? We cannot wantonly throw together experiments and expect knowledge to come out.</li>
          <li>What are the most productive research directions for reaching a working theory and practice of emergent language?</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Other Work</h2>
        <p>
        Much of the work I do in philosophy also relates computing, so if you are interested in the intersection between language, cognition, philosophy, and computers, definitely check the <a href="philosophy.html">page</a> out.
        Most of the philosophy paper are from my undergraduate years, and my experience since then has shed light on the shortfallings of these works. That being said, I think that is a positive observation, lest my intellectual development have stagnated!
